## Codecademy Portfolio Project JavaScript Syntax

### General Instructions:
For this project, you will build a message generator program. 
Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. 
Youâ€™re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an 
astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your 
program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least 
three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far 
to build the program and customize it to your liking.

#### Project Objectives:
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer
#### Prerequisites:
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line


#### My Solution:
In that project I decided to choose the imaginary smart fridge's message alerting sample.
The message looks like:

`Hi <name>! How are you doing? By the way, we are run out of <list-of-products>. Please,
could you go to <store> and pick up all of that stuff?`

- `<name>` - is randomly selected name from the list of people names;
- `<list-of-products>` - randomly selected product items to buy, from 1 to 5 items, 
quantity of items is also randomly selected;
- `<store>` - randomly selected store name, accordingly.
